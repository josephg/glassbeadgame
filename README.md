# Glass bead game timer

This is a simple timer to play [glass bead games](https://glassbeadgames.com/). The timer on their site is a bit janky so I made my own!

This is pretty thrown together too - but it should work a bit better!

[Play online here](https://glassbead.seph.codes/)

## Running the code

Install nodejs, clone the repo then

```
npm install
npm start
```


## TODO

- [x] Init rooms with the name of an archetopic in them with that archetopic
- [x] MAke the timer actually work (sound + animate)
- [x] Save sessions on restart
- [x] Make round display work
- [ ] Lock users out of a room
- [ ] Styling (I mean, this is never done... but its usable!)
- [ ] Add archetopic logos
- [ ] Deployment?
